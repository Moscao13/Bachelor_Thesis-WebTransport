Thesis activity for Computer engineering bachelor degree at "Universit√† degli studi di Bologna", Italy.

## Getting Started

WebTransport is a new web protocol framework for real-time communications providing low-latency and high-throughput connections between clients and servers.
It relies on HTTP/3 application protocol and introduce a new transport layer protocol based on UDP, the QUIC protocol, specifically designed for real time communications.
